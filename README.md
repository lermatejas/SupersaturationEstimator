This algorithm simulates the supersaturation estimator with error bounds. 
 The authors of this study are:
1-Phd(c) Ing. Humberto Morales, 
2-Dr. Ing. Fernando Di Sciascio, 
3-Dra. Ing. Adriana Amicarrelli, 
4-Msc. Ing. Estefania Aguirre.

The authors have implemented their own methodology to obtain and model-based estimator and it error bound of  3 standard deviations.
The estimator is based on the C Crystallization C model proposed by Damour[1] and a supersaturation model.
